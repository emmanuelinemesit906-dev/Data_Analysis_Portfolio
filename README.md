# Project 4: Ride-Sharing-Case-Study 

# Ride-Sharing User Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This case study analyzes ride-sharing user behavior to uncover differences between member and casual riders. The objective is to generate actionable insights that support data-driven business decisions related to user engagement and service optimization.

---

## Business Objective
To understand how ride behavior differs between user types and identify patterns that can inform customer retention and operational strategy.

---

## Hypothesis
- Members have longer average ride durations compared to casual riders.
- Casual riders account for a higher number of trips than members.

---

## Data Overview & Preparation
- Dataset contains historical ride data including ride duration and user type.
- Data cleaning steps included:
  - Removing invalid and zero-duration rides
  - Ensuring correct time formatting (hh:mm:ss)
  - Verifying consistency across user categories

---

## Key Insights
- Members consistently record longer average ride lengths, suggesting higher engagement.
- Casual riders generate a higher volume of trips, indicating usage driven by convenience rather than long-term commitment.

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, pivot tables, charts)
- Power BI (data visualization)
- Google Drive (case study sharing)

---

## Deliverable
- 📄 **Presentation (PDF):**  
  A concise slide deck summarizing objectives, methodology, insights, and recommendations.
